# Hawt Sauce

## Ingredience

- 1 1/4 lbs cherry bomb peppers, or your choice of fresh chiles, tops removed
- 6 garlic cloves
- 1 1/2 tbsp coarse kosher salt*
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar

## Steps

### Step 1

Combine chili peppers, garlic cloves, salt, and water in a food processor.

### Step 2

Process until you reach the texture of a chunky salsa.

### Step 3

Transfer to a clean glass container and cover with a cheesecloth. Leave on the counter at room temperature for 24 hours.

### Step 4
Add the apple cider vinegar and stir to combine. Leave on the counter, covered with a cheesecloth for 5-7 days (if you have time, go the full week!).

### Step 5

After 1 week, transfer to a blender and purée until smooth. Pour through a cheesecloth and strainer to separate the seeds and any leftover pulp. Using food safe gloves, squeeze out all the juice from the remaining pulp.

### Step 6
Transfer to a clean jar or ideally an old hot sauce bottle and refrigerate. It should last for several months.
Separation is normal, shake before use.

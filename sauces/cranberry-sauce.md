## Method
1. Combine the sugar and orange juice in a large saucepan and bring to the boil
2. Stir in the cranberries and clementine zest, then simmer until the cranberries are tender but still holding their shape – this will take about 5 minutes if using frozen cranberries and a little longer if using fresh 
3. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and stir in the port/Cointreau (if using)
4. Refrigerate until needed, the sauce will thicken as it cools
5. Remove from the fridge an hour before serving

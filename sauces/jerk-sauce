# Homemade Jerk Sauce

## Ingredients

- 4-6 Scotch Bonnet peppers, chopped
- 1 small red onion, chopped
- 4-6 garlic cloves, chopped
- 4 stalks scallions, end trimmed
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup vinegar (use white vinegar or apple cider vinegar, to your preference)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice from half a lime (about 1/4 cup lime juice)
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon allspice
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or use fresh, if available)
- Salt and pepper to taste (I usually use 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon black pepper)

## Steps

### Step 1

Add all of the ingredients to a food processor or blender â€“ scotch bonnet peppers, red onion, garlic cloves, scallions,  soy sauce, vinegar, olive oi, lime juice, ginger, brown sugar, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, thyme, and salt and pepper. 

## Tips

This is a fairly hot sauce recipe. I rate it as medium-high because of the inclusion of the Scotch Bonnet peppers. Scotch Bonnet peppers offer quite a bit of heat. They range from 100,000 to 350,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU) which is anywhere from 12 to 140 times hotter than a jalapeno pepper.

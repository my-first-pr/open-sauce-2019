## Steps

### Step 1

Place all ingredients in a food processor, blender or large chopper.

### Step 2

Process well to form a fragrant Thai green curry sauce. Taste-test the sauce for salt and spice. If too salty for your taste, add a squeeze of lime or lemon juice. If not salty enough, add more fish sauce or salt. Add more chili for more heat.

### Step 3

Your curry sauce is now ready to be used. You can bottle up any leftovers and keep them in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Freeze thereafter. Enjoy!

## Tips

- If using a pestle & mortar: Pound all dry herbs & spices together to form a paste, then gradually add the wet ingredients, stirring until smooth. Your curry paste is now ready to use.
- To make this sauce into a delicious Thai curry, drizzle some vegetable oil into a wok or deep-sided frying pan and swirl around. Add the green curry sauce, plus other ingredients (your choice of protein â€” chicken, pork, beef, tofu or vegetables). Bring to a light boil and then reduce heat to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally. If more sauce is needed, add chicken stock or faux chicken stock or a combination of stock and water. When the curry is fully cooked, reduce heat to minimum and add the reserved 1/4 can coconut milk. Taste-test before serving, adding more fish sauce or salt if needed. Sprinkle over fresh basil and serve with rice. Enjoy!

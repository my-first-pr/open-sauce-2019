# Homemade Hollandaise Saucy-sauce

## Ingredients

- 125g butter
- 2 egg yolks
- ½ tsp white wine vinegar or tarragon vinegar
- lemon juice
- cayenne pepper

## Steps

#### Step 1
Melt 125g butter in a saucepan and skim any white solids from the surface. Keep the butter warm. 

### Step 2
Put 2 egg yolks, ½ tsp white wine or tarragon vinegar, a pinch of salt and a splash of ice-cold water in a metal or glass bowl that will fit over a small pan.

### Step 3
Whisk for a few mins, then put the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water and whisk continuously until pale and thick, about 3-5 mins.

### Step 4
Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the melted butter, bit by bit until it’s all incorporated and you have a creamy hollandaise. (If it gets too thick, add a splash of water.)

### Step 5
Season with a squeeze of lemon juice and a little cayenne pepper. Keep warm until needed.

Ingredients

2 egg yolks
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
250ml sunflower oil
2 tsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice

Method

1. Tip the egg yolks and mustard into a bowl, season with salt and pepper and whisk together until completely combined. Whisking constantly, add a small drop of oil and whisk until completely combined, then add another drop and continue a drop at a time until the yolks and oil combine and start to thicken. Once youâ€™re confident the oil and eggs are coming together you can add the oil a bit more at a time, but be patient, as adding the oil too quickly will cause the mayonnaise to split and curdle. 
2. Once all the oil has been whisked into the eggs and you have a thick, spoonable mayonnaise, whisk in the vinegar or lemon juice and season to taste. Will keep in the fridge for two days.

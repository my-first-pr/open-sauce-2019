##Footnotes

###Notes
Leave some of all the Scotch Bonnets with seeds for a spicier sauce. Replace the Scotch Bonnets with habaneros or jalapenos for a "milder" sauce - or if Scotch Bonnets are not available in your area.
Use peppers of the same color when available, to keep the sauce a consistent color.
